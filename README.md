This is my implementation of [Conway's Game of Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) that I did in C++ about 14 months ago, at the beginning of my Comp Sci degree program.

I resisted the temptation to check out a "reference" implementation to see how it was typically done.  This made it more of a challenge, and I think I probably made a few odd choices, but I definitely learned a lot from the experience, particularly about **pointers**, and the curses library.
